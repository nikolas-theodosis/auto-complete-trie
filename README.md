# auto-complete-trie

Makefile is included to compile the program.

Execute the program by typing:  
**./typing-assistant /path_to_dictionary**

It should be mentioned that if the path to dictionary is ommited 
then it will be used the default dictionary that exists in the /home/user folder.

While typing, by hitting tab the 8 most used words will be shown.  
You can choose the one you want to fill in by pressing the number that corresponds to the word you want.  
For example, if you press "2", the second most used word will be used to replace the text you typed.  

Moreover, when you type a word that does not exist in the dictionary, this word is being added in it and can be used to complete the words that will follow.
